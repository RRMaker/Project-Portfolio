        <h1>Hi.My Name is Rohan Ravulapelli, and this is my first project on visual studio code. Visual studio code is a platform that allows you to code different languages, such as html(HyperTextMarkupLanguage), js(JavaScript), and css(CascadingStyleSheets). You can also get and use functions such as console log. Speaking of which, let me explain console log. Console log is a function that lets you show the output of variables in the console table. This can be useful because it lets the user and the developer see the output in both regular and coded looks. You can acsess this by right clicking on the screen, then clicking inspect element.</h1>
        <script>
            console.log("Hi This is my first project");
            var first_name="Rohan ";
            var second_name="Ravulapelli";

            var full_name=first_name.concat(second_name);
            console.log(full_name);

            var a = 10;
            var b = 5 ;

            var add = a + b ;
            console.log(add);

            var c = 2 ;
            var d = 3 ;

            var add2 = c + d ;
            console.log(add2);

            var e = 20 ;
            var f = 30 ;

            var add3 = e + f ;
            console.log(add3);

            var g = 2 ;
            console.log(g);
